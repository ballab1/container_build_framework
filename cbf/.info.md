# This folder contains buildtime bashlib library files. 
# It is to setup the appropriate functions for the buildtime environment  (build.sh)
#
#  The bashlib files in this folder are copied into /tmp/container_build_framework/crf folder by the Dockerfile
#  and are 'sourced' at buildtime by ../bin/init.libraries
