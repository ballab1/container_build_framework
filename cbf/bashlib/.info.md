# This folder contains buildtime/runtime bashlib library files.
# It is to setup the appropriate functions for the buildtime environment (build.sh) and for the runtime environment (docker-entrypoint.sh)
#
#  The files in this folder are copied to /tmp/container_build_framework/crf/bashlib folder by the Dockerfile
#  and are 'sourced' at buildtime by ../bin/init.libraries 
#  or are 'sourced' at runtime by /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh
