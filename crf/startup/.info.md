# This folder contains scripts which are run by the docker-entrypoint.sh at startup. 
#
# These scripts perform the custom actions required during container startup, such as
#      - modifying permissions or ownership of files that exist on mounted volumes
#      - applying custom parameters from runtime environment variables (setting GITHUB access)
#
