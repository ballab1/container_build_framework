# This folder contains runtime property files. 
# It is to setup the appropriate environment variables for the runtime environment
#
#  The property files in this folder are
#      - either copied to,
#      - or generated into
#  this folder by the build process and are 'sourced' at runtime by /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh
