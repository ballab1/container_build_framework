# This folder contains runtime bashlib library files. 
# It is to setup the appropriate functions for the runtime environment  (docker-entrypoint.sh)
#
#  The bashlib files in this folder are copied into this folder by the build process
#  and are 'sourced' at runtime by /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh
